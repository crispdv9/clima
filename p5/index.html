            Leyen, los acuerdos de París, la nueva presidencia finlandesa y el objetivo neutral son sólo algunas de las razones.</h2>
          <h2>Tras las elecciones, acosada por una mayoría demasiado estrecha, Ursula von der Leyen, próxima presidenta de la Comisión Europea, hizo grandes promesas climáticas para obtener la aprobación del Parlamento Europeo en julio de 2019: un Pacto Verde para Europa, convertir al Banco Europeo de Inversiones en un banco climático y otras promesas que finalmente allanaron su camino hacia la aprobación de su candidatura.</h2>
          <h2>La UE y los Estados miembros ya han asumido hace tiempo que no podrán escapar del debate climático. Aquí ofrecemos las claves para entender el marco europeo en el que se desarrollarán los acontecimientos clave del próximo lustro. </h2>

              <p> La lucha de la UE por combatir el cambio climático no es algo nuevo y así lo dejó claro en 1997 al formar parte del Protocolo de Kioto que introdujo un objetivo de reducción de emisiones. De 2013 a 2020 durará el segundo periodo de compromiso que firman 38 países, entre ellos los 28 que forman parte de la Unión Europea para reducir las emisiones un 18% como mínimo con respecto a niveles de 1990.</p>
              <p> Este acuerdo se encuentra con varios fallos. Principalmente faltan en él  países desarrollados y con importante peso en el cambio climático; Estados Unidos decidió no firmar; Canadá se echó atrás antes de terminar el primer acuerdo y Rusia, Japón y Nueva Zelanda decidieron no formar parte del segundo acuerdo.
Otro intento de luchar contra las emisiones fue la Conferencia de París sobre el Cambio Climático que se celebró del 30 de noviembre al 11 de diciembre de 2015 y que entró en vigor en 2016. En ese momento, se unieron 55 países que suman el 55% de las emisiones mundiales de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI). La Unión Europea jugó un rol fundamental en este acuerdo, y ha defendido ser la principal protectora del acuerdo, especialmente desde que Donald Trump, presidente americano, anunciara que EEUU abandonaría el acuerdo.</p>
              <p> Entre los propósitos se encuentra el de limitar el calentamiento global por debajo de 2ºC. Este entró en vigor en 2016 y todos los países de la UE han ratificado el acuerdo. Para acelerar el cumplimiento de las propuestas, los países se reunieron de nuevo en la conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el cambio climático de 2017, mostrando su compromiso con el tratado.</p>
              <p> La siguiente Cumbre del Clima (COP25), que tendrá lugar del 2 al 13 de diciembre en Madrid tras su anulación en Chile por los problemas políticos a los que se está enfrentando el país, debe ser el siguiente paso a la materialización real de lo que ya se acordó en París.

A través de tecnología, política industrial, economía e investigación pretenden cumplir con lo acordado en París y mejorar los números en los países de la UE.
                </p>
                <p> Actualmente el objetivo fijado es que para 2030 se hayan reducido las emisiones de gases invernadero en un 40% respecto a los niveles de 1990. El objetivo es que la UE sea climáticamente neutra para 2050, pero al ritmo actual no será posible alcanzar dicha meta, que se traduce en una reducción del 80% de las emisiones.
                </p>
                <p> Por eso el Parlamento Europeo, en una resolución de marzo de 2019, solicitó que se establecieran objetivos más duros para 2030 como única forma de lograr la meta final dos décadas después.
                </p>
                <p> El pulso por el objetivo de la neutralidad climática es, seguramente, uno de los más relevantes que se están produciendo en Europa y muestra una nueva grieta en el club comunitario: un oeste más ambicioso con los objetivos del Acuerdo de París, y un este preocupado por el impacto que la transición ecológica puede tener sobre sus economías dependientes todavía de las energías fósiles, como es el caso de Polonia, Hungría o Rumanía.
                </p>
                <p> Hay tres países que han convertido en ley el objetivo de la neutralidad climática. Suecia tiene ya integrada en su corpus legal la necesidad de alcanzar las emisiones netas cero en 2045, Francia y el Reino Unido lo han establecido para 2050.
                </p>
                <p> Angela Merkel, canciller alemana, se ha comprometido también públicamente con este objetivo. “La discusión no es si alcanzarla, sino cómo alcanzamos esta meta”, aseguró la líder germana el pasado mayo poco después de establecer un “gabinete climático” que traza la estrategia alemana para que Berlín logre la neutralidad de carbono en 2050.
                </p>
                <p> Alemania tiene el objetivo de recortar sus emisiones un 55% en 2030, pero el ritmo es inferior al esperado y la proyección es que solo logre para 2020 una reducción del 33% frente al 40% esperado. Actualmente el Parlamento alemán debate una legislación que convertirá en ley los objetivos, pero el Gobierno de Merkel ha eliminado del último borrador un objetivo para el año 2040 aunque manteniendo el del 55% para 2030, un movimiento que ha sido criticado por activistas y partidos ecológicos.
                </p>
                <p> España es uno de los países más ambiciosos en la los objetivos climáticos dentro de la Unión Europea: se encuentra en el núcleo duro que conforman también Países Bajos, Dinamarca y Suecia. El Congreso de los Diputados apoyó en septiembre de 2019 la declaración de emergencia climática en España.
                </p>
                <p> No hay una única forma de alcanzar la neutralidad climática, y cada país va intentando descubrir su propio camino. España, por ejemplo, pretende emitir “bonos verdes” que financien la construcción de infraestructuras que faciliten la transición ecológica por valor de 47.000 millones de euros.

                <p>Hace solo un año un joven sueca de por entonces 15 años llamada Greta Thunberg decidió saltarse las clases el viernes para protestar ante el Parlamento de Suecia por su inacción en la lucha contra el cambio climático. Hace unas semanas la joven Thunberg sacó a la calle a millones de jóvenes de todo el mundo y acudió a la ONU para hablar ante la asamblea general de Acción del Clima. "La gente está sufriendo. La gente se está muriendo. Ecosistemas enteros se están derrumbando. Estamos en el comienzo de una extinción masiva. Y de lo único que podéis hablar es de dinero y cuentos de hadas de crecimiento económico eterno. ¡Cómo os atrevéis!", dedicaba la activista a los líderes mundiales. Thunberg ha sido la cara visible de una ola verde que ha sacudido Europa, también en el ámbito político. Hay varios factores que han ayudado a ello.
                </p>
                <p>Las últimas elecciones europeas fueron un éxito sin precedentes para Los Verdes, que obtuvieron un total de 74 escaños, un 30% más de lo obtenido en los comicios de 2014, convirtiéndose en un bloque clave para lo gobernabilidad de la cámara.

                <p> Los buenos resultados de Los Verdes van más allá de Alemania. Los ecologistas lograron la tercera posición con el 13,48% de los votos en Francia, solo por detrás de la formación de Emmanuel Macron y la de Marine Le Pen. Fueron, además, el partido más votado entre el electorado de 18 a 34 años.
                </p>
                <p>  Estos datos positivos se concentraron en aquellos países en los que el cambio climático es la primera preocupación de los ciudadanos, es decir, Suecia, Dinamarca, Finlandia, Alemania y el Benelux (Bélgica, Países Bajos y Luxemburgo).
                </p>
                <p>   Los partidos verdes encuentran sus raíces en los movimientos anti-nucleares de finales de los sesenta y la década de los setenta, fuertemente arraigados en las universidades de los países más industrializados de Europa. Su influencia no llegó a los países sureños, que, de hecho, siguen sin contar con una presencia relevante de partidos ecologistas.
                 </p>
                <p>    La transición de un movimiento protesta en las calles a la política tradicional fue dura. El primer político verde en entrar en un gobierno fue el letón Indulis Emsis, en 1993, y que después de convertiría, en 2004, en el primer jefe de Gobierno del mundo de un partido ecologista. En Finlandia la transición también iba a buen ritmo, y en 1995 el líder de los verdes se convertía en Ministro de Medio Ambiente.
                 </p>
                 <p>       Los Verdes alemanes serían claves en los Gobiernos socialdemócratas alemanes de finales de los noventa y hasta 2005, y en Bélgica también entraron en el Gobierno a comienzos del siglo XXI. Pero la crisis económica afectó mucho a estos movimientos ecologistas, que en las elecciones europeas de 2014, tras un alentador resultado e 2009, volvían a bajar en escaños.
                  </p>
                  <p>   Durante los últimos años se ha ido produciendo una “centralización” del mensaje en los partidos verdes. Los estudiantes que protestaban en las calles en las últimas décadas del siglo XX son ahora urbanitas de clase media-alta con estudios superiores. El mensaje del partido se fue adaptando a los cambios que habían ido sufriendo sus votantes, pero a la crisis económica se unió la crisis migratoria y el debate político se complicó para las formaciones ecologistas, con un ambiente cada vez más polarizado.
                   </p>
                   <p> Hubo pocas alegrías. Pero llegó finales de 2016. Alexander van der Bellen, el candidato ‘verde’ a las elecciones presidenciales en Austria, vencía al candidato de la extrema derecha Norbert Hofer. Pareció ser un punto de inflexión.
                    </p>
                    <p> Los dos siguientes años estarían cargados de alegrías para las formaciones ecologistas en el Benelux: en Países Bajos lograban un gran crecimiento en las elecciones de 2017 y en 2018 se hacían con la alcaldía de Amsterdam, mientras en Luxemburgo se ponían mano a mano con los socialdemócratas y en Bruselas, capital de Bélgica, se convertían en la segunda fuerza política más votada.
                     </p>
                     <p> Los Verdes parecen tener un futuro prometedor, pero tendrán que consolidar los buenos resultados en los próximos años y mantener movilizado y concienciado a su electorado. A la vez, los últimos años han demostrado que hay algunos acontecimientos, como crisis económicas o migratorias, que pueden afectar de forma crucial a estas formaciones.

                      <p>Ursula von der Leyen probablemente no sería la sucesora de Jean-Claude Juncker al frente de la Comisión Europea si no fura por las promesas hechas durante su discurso ante los distintos grupos y ante el Pleno de Estrasburgo en julio de 2019. Y esas promesas fueron, fundamentalmente, relacionadas con el clima.
                    Y hablar de clima es hablar de economía, algo que Von der Leyen sabe bien. Convertir en ley el compromiso de alcanzar la neutralidad climática en 2050, como se comprometió a hacer la alemana, significa que la UE tiene que estar lista para sacar la billetera. </p>

<p>Alcanzar la neutralidad va a ser extremadamente caro. Los cálculos de la propia Comisión Europea indican que para lograr una transición ecológica exitosa todavía falta aumentar la inversión anual en unos 175.000 – 290.000 millones de euros. Y ahí entra en juego el “Pacto Verde Europeo” propuesto por Von der Leyen y que estaría bajo la dirección del holandés Frans Timmermans en la próxima Comisión Europea.
El futuro pasará por una nueva fijación de precios del carbono, más allá del sistema europeo de comercio de emisiones (ETS), una inversión sostenible, una nueva política industrial y fondos para lograr que la transición ecológica sea justa también en materia social.
</p>
<p>Von der Leyen ya trabaja con la hipótesis de un futuro arancel al carbono en frontera, una propuesta que impondría tasas a los productos que no cumplan con las normas europeas en materia climática, y también conoce perfectamente la necesidad de invertir mucho más en la innovación de la industria.
Por otro lado, el Banco Europeo de Inversiones (BEI) ya llevó a cabo un paso importante hace unos días, cuando anunció que en 2021 dejará de financiar proyectos de energías fósiles, algo que les acerca al objetivo de Von der Leyen de convertirlo en un banco climático. El BEI se ha establecido como meta para 2025 dedicar la mitad de su financiación a proyectos de sostenibilidad y de cumplimiento de los objetivos climáticos.
</p>
<p>Aunque Timmermans será el encargado de supervisar los elementos “políticos” de la transición ecológica, lo cierto es que Von der Leyen ha encargado al conservador Valdis Dombrovskis el control de los elementos económicos, como la conversión del BEI en un banco climático o la liberación de fondos para la transición justa.
</p>
<p>Pero no va a ser fácil para la alemana cumplir ni con sus promesas ni con sus objetivos. Porque los Estados miembros van a poner trabas a aquellas medidas que sean demasiado ambiciosas para algunas economías del club.
Von der Leyen aseguró en su discurso ante el Pleno que su comisión sería la “geopolítica”, pero lo cierto es que también tendrá que ser la “climática”, uno de los retos fundamentales para el futuro de Bruselas y de la UE.
